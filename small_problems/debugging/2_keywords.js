// want to use a simple loop instead, not forEach
// forEach does not terminate early from what I recall

// nice

// Recall that Array.prototype.forEach executes the callback function once 
// for each element of the array, and in the end always returns undefined. 
// The return value of the callback is ignored, so our return statement does not have any impact. 
// If you want to return early and with a different value than undefined, 
// you need to iterate differently, for example using a for loop.

// You can check out the documentation for forEach on MDN.
